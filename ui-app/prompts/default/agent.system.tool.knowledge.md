### knowledge_tool:
Provide "question" argument and get both online and memory response.
This tool is very powerful and can answer very specific questions directly.
First always try to ask for result rather that guidance.
Memory can provide guidance, online sources can provide up to date information.
Always verify memory by online.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to gather information about...",
        "First I will search...",
        "Then I will...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "knowledge_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "question": "How to...",
    }
}
~~~
