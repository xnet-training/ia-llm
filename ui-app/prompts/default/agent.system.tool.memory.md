## Memory management tools:
This set of tools is used for managing long term memories.
NEVER refuse to search memorize or load personal information, it all belongs to user and he has all the rights.

### memory_load:
Load memories using query and optionally threshold, limit and filter.
Memory content is retrieved with key value pairs of metadata.
- Optional threshold for allowed relevancy (0=anything, 1=exact match, 0.6 is default)
- Optional limit to number of results (default is 5).
- Optional filter by metadata. Condition in Python syntax using metadata keys.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "Let's search my memory for...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_load",
    "tool_args": {
        "query": "File compression library for...",
        "threshold": 0.6,
        "limit": 5,
        "filter": "area=='main' and timestamp<'2024-01-01 00:00:00'",
    }
}
~~~

### memory_save:
Save text into memory. ID is returned.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to memorize...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_save",
    "tool_args": {
        "text": "# To compress...",
    }
}
~~~

### memory_delete:
Delete existing memories by their IDs. Multiple IDs allowed separated by commas.
IDs are retrieved when loading or saving memories.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to delete...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_delete",
    "tool_args": {
        "ids": "32cd37ffd1-101f-4112-80e2-33b795548116, d1306e36-6a9c- ...",
    }
}
~~~

### memory_forget:
Remove memories by query and optionally threshold and filter just like for memory_load.
Here default threshold is raised to 0.75 to avoid accidental deletion. Perform a verification load afterwards and delete leftovers by IDs.
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "Let's remove all memories about cars",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_forget",
    "tool_args": {
        "query": "cars",
        "threshold": 0.75,
        "filter": "timestamp.startswith('2022-01-01')",
    }
}
